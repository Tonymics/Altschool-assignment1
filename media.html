            <h1>Beginning of A Journey: My Software Engineering Flight Process</h1>
            <p>
                In this short message I intend not to go to far, and I would rather
                show a picture of the most recent journey in my life, serving my
                father's land. I graduated from the University of Benin, and studied
                Business Administration, a discipline that was meant to be a 4 years
                course, I ended up studying for five and a half year, having witnessed
                a strike which lasted for almost a year and also there was the
                covid-19 pandemic, all this took a major strain in my academic
                journey, but I keep on striving and aiming for more success.
            </p>

                and computer which was further inginted by my professor who encouraged
                me acquire another skill aside the bacholor's degree I have in

            My major goal at Altschoolafrica is to become a full-stack engineer,
            that is someone who knows both the frontend and backend engineering.
            Then I would further in acquiring both cybersecurity and cloud
            enginerring expertises. I also aim to contribure more to the open 
            source community, contributing more to javaScript, simply because 
            javaScript is my favourite language, and i've heard and listended to 
            many senior engineer talk about the issues or problems about javaScript 
            has a programming language, I intend to find some of these problem and 
            provide solutions to them.
