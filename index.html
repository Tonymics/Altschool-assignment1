            My favourite sport is basketball, football and table tennis. When I
            don't have anything to do, I love to surf the net, open my mail and
            watch anime. Regarding my likes and dislike, I love to surf the
            internet for information , listening to music, communicating with my
            loved ones, my dislikes include people who gossiping, and lie.

            at Altschoolafrica, with student ID: ALT/SOE/024/0020, within the
            trackfield as a Frontend engineer . My reason for joining

            open a wide window of opportunities for me.
